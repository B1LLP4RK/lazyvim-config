## Major changes from LazyVim

- Neovim detects the terminal environment whether it is in Kitty or Wezterm. Snacks.image is turned off accordingly to avoid issues in other terminals like windows terminal.

## Installation

### WSL Ubuntu

- Assuming a freshly installed Ubuntu(this means git and curl is available as default), copy and paste the following script to your WSL terminal. Give permission and provide passwords when prompted.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade

sudo apt install build-essential gcc lua5.1 luarocks fzf ripgrep fd-find npm nodejs

/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
USERNAME=$(whoami)
echo >> /home/$USERNAME/.bashrc
echo 'eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> /home/$USERNAME/.bashrc
eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"

brew install neovim
brew install jesseduffield/lazygit/lazygit

mkdir -p ~/.config/
cd ~/.config
git clone https://github.com/B1LLP4RK/lazyvim-config.git
mv lazyvim-config nvim
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.3/install.sh | bash
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"  # This loads nvm bash_completion
nvm install node
```

Above script is just a short version of the one below

```bash
# updating and upgrading packages
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade

# install homebrew
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
# Run these commands in your terminal to add Homebrew to your PATH:
USERNAME=$(whoami)
echo >> /home/$USERNAME/.bashrc
echo 'eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> /home/$USERNAME/.bashrc
eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
# Install Homebrew's dependencies if you have sudo access:
sudo apt install build-essential
# For more information, see:
# https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-on-Linux

# We recommend that you install GCC:
# brew install gcc
apt install gcc


# install neovim
brew install neovim

# install lazy nvim requirements
sudo apt install lua5.1 luarocks

# install lazyvim reqruiements
brew install jesseduffield/lazygit/lazygit
# apt install gcc
sudo apt install fzf ripgrep fd-find

mkdir -p ~/.config/
cd ~/.config
git clone https://github.com/B1LLP4RK/lazyvim-config.git
mv lazyvim-config nvim

# install nvm node and npm for mason.nvim
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.3/install.sh | bash
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"  # This loads nvm bash_completion
nvm install node

# for mason.nvim
sudo apt install nodejs npm
```

- Now run the command `nvim`. Some errors will show up as neovim boots, but ignore them with a few presses of space or enter key.
- Exit via the command `:q`
- Rerun `nvim`

#### notes on clipboard

There is a issue in how line endings are handled as described [here](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim/discussions/5954#discussioncomment-13178737)
However I found a workaround.
Use win32yank in this [link](<https://github.com/equalsraf/win32yank>
I personally do not prefer this method due to its poor documentation, but too bad its the only option.

Assuming windows and WSL environment,

Download the exe file from release page
Go to /usr/local/ via cd /usr/local and create a directory win32yank with mkdir win32yank
add the path via adding export PATH=/usr/local/win32yank:$PATH to your .bashrc
move the downloaded win32yank.exe to the /usr/local/win32yank
add below to your `~/.config/nvim/lua/config/options.lua

```
vim.g.clipboard = {
  name = "Win32Yank",
  copy = {
    ["+"] = "win32yank.exe -i --crlf",
    ["*"] = "win32yank.exe -i --crlf",
  },
  paste = {
    ["+"] = "win32yank.exe -o --lf",
    ["*"] = "win32yank.exe -o --lf",
  },
  cache_enabled = 0,
}
```

### Windows

- [Wezterm](https://wezterm.org/index.html) can be used if you need snacks.image and other graphic usage of lazyvim.

### Termux

- Use the termux branch of this repo and not the main.
- tips: lua and luarocks is available in termux pkg by `pkg install lua51 luarocks`
